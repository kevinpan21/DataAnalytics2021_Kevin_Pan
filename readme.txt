Description:
	Cloud Streets
	The organization of cumulus clouds into elongated rows oriented parallel to the mean boundary layer flow is a phenomenon often referred to as cloud streets. 
	Organized cumulus cloud streets are the visual manifestation of underlying boundary layer roll circulations commonly referred to as horizontal convective rolls. 
	Formation of boundary layer rolls is attributed to two instability mechanisms â€“ thermal and dynamic instability.
	Direct impacts of cloud streets are fairly minimal as they typically do not precipitate or have meaningful environmental impacts aside from surface radiation. 
	The effects of cloud streets are most notable in the presence of sea breeze circulations as intersections of roll circulations and sea breeze circulations are known to force convective initiation. 
	Coastal convection is a primary source of precipitation in these settings and can grow upscale to propagating mesoscale convective systems that modulate the regional and even global precipitation budgets.
